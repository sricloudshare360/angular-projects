Angular UI Screens are integrated with Rest API using Expressjs. It is similar to mean stack, but instead of mongo, it will use postgres sql. include codespace template, dev container configuration as of workspace; include the instructions to start, test the application, include seed data;  Break the application into 3 parts, front end , back-end, database, the front end will contain angular code, back-end will be express with rest api, database folder will have docker compose file which will start postgres db and postgres ui to login. the dev container will have all the 3 configurations. It will first start progress and postgress ui, the starts the express restapi and finally starts the angular;
Provide the project code as zip file to download and locally. Please provide instructions to test the rest api using postman. as soon as db starts it should also inject seed data automatically. will be using github codespaces for running the application
